Global transcriptional differences between healthy and cancer cells, for each patient individually, were determined using the Seurat’s FindAllMarkers function (with parameters only.pos = TRUE, min.pct = 0.25, logfc.threshold = 0.25 and with adjusted p-value threshold ≤ 0.05). Comparisons between patients were performed using the Van de Peer lab’s Venn diagram tool (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/).

Figures were exported in svg mode and used to generate final graphics.
