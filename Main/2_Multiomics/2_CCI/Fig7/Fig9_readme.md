# Figure 7: Multi-omics analysis of LR interaction between IL34 and CSF1R

To explore the integrative potential of our multi-omics skin cancer dataset, we finally present a case study into cell-cell interaction mediated by the LR pair IL34-CSF1R. IL34 is a cytokine whose receptor CSF1R (which also binds to ligand CSF1) activates immune cells, in particular macrophages and Langerhans cells (Stanley & Chitu, 2014). Mice deficient in IL34 (or its receptor CSF1R) lack epidermal Langerhans cells and microglia (Y. Wang et al., 2012), while other immune cell types are unaffected (Greter et al., 2012). Lower IL34 levels have been associated with worse survival outcomes in cervical cancer cells, potentially due to reduced Langerhans cell activation and associated reduced anti-tumour immune response (Tuong et al., 2021). Conversely, high IL34 expression has been shown to correlate with poor survival in lung cancer cell culture models (Baghdadi et al., 2016) and patients (Baghdadi et al., 2018), being implicated in the activation of tumour-associated macrophages via its interaction with CSF1R (Baghdadi et al., 2016)(Foucher et al., 2013).
